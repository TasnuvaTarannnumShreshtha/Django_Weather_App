# Weather App
## Introduction
This Django-based weather application provides temperature forecasts for the coolest 10 districts in Bangladesh based on average temperatures at 2 PM for the next 7 days, utilizing the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) API for weather data retrieval. Additionally, it compares the 2 PM temperatures of your current location and a destination specified for travel on a given date, helping users decide whether to travel there.
